# AWS Complete Learning: Your Path to Cloud Expertise üöÄ

This project is a comprehensive, hands-on guide to mastering key concepts and services within Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's designed to take you from foundational principles to advanced deployment strategies, giving you the practical skills needed to build and manage modern cloud infrastructure.

---

### **What You'll Learn**

By completing this project, you will gain practical, hands-on experience with the following core AWS services and concepts:

* **Website Deployment:** üåê
    Learn how to host a static website using **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**, configure its public access, and leverage it for cost-effective content delivery.

* **DNS and Custom Domains:** üó∫Ô∏è
    Master **Amazon Route 53** to manage your project's DNS settings. You'll learn how to register a custom domain and configure record sets to point to your AWS resources.

* **Scaling and High Availability:** üìà
    Understand how to use **Auto Scaling Groups** to automatically adjust your compute capacity based on demand, ensuring your application remains performant and available under any load.

* **Global Deployment and CDN:** üåç
    Deploy your content globally and reduce latency using **Amazon CloudFront**, a Content Delivery Network (CDN). You'll learn how to cache content at edge locations worldwide for faster user access.

* **Load Balancing:** ‚öñÔ∏è
    Implement **Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)** to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances. You'll work with both **Application Load Balancers (ALB)** for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and **Network Load Balancers (NLB)** for high-performance TCP/UDP traffic.

* **Firewall Rules and Security:** üõ°Ô∏è
    Secure your infrastructure by configuring **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs (NACLs)**. You'll learn to create inbound and outbound firewall rules to control access to your instances and subnets.

* **Networking, IPs, and Subnets:** üï∏Ô∏è
    Dive into the fundamentals of **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** networking. You will learn to manage **subnets** (public and private), configure an **Internet Gateway (IG)**, set up **routing tables**, and understand the roles of public and private **IP addresses** and **ports**.

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** üìù
    Automate the provisioning of your AWS resources using **IaC**. You'll work with **AWS CloudFormation** to define your entire infrastructure in a template, making your deployments repeatable and consistent.

* **Container Management:** üì¶
    Learn to deploy and manage containerized applications using **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)**. You will understand how to build task definitions, run tasks, and create services to manage container fleets.

* **Full-Stack Web App Deployment:** üíª
    Synthesize all the above skills to deploy a complete full-stack web application. You'll learn how to integrate front-end and back-end services, database connectivity, and an API layer.

* **SSL/TLS Working:** üîí
    Secure your web applications with encryption. You'll learn how **SSL/TLS** certificates work, how to provision them for free using **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**, and how to attach them to your Load Balancers and CloudFront distributions.
